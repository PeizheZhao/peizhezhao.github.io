<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Peizhe Zhao, a student at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology majoring in Artificial Intelligence, concurrently pursuing a BE in Applied Computing at South East Technological University. My research focuses on computer vision, deep learning applications, and multi-source information fusion. I have published papers on fabric defect detection, tennis match prediction, and athlete performance analysis.

My research interest includes computer vision and deep learning applications. I have published papers at international conferences with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gGhv_kQAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>several</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gGhv_kQAAAAJ'></a>).
